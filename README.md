# Landing Card

## Description

This page is my business card. It allows me to give someone my essential links like LinkedIn and my website.

## Usage

Using Apple Shortcut and the double-tap function of my IPhone, I can open this page at a moments notice.
The QRCode located at the bottom of this page leads directly back to this page. This way someone can easily scan it and interact with it.

## Features

The JavaScript of this page check the viewport width of the device and when the device appears to be a desktop or a tablet, they get redirected to jlcd.de/stable.
This way I can ensure the best user experience on all devices.
